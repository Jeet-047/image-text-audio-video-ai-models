# 🤖 AI Models – Image, Text, and Video Data

This section showcases various AI/ML models built to process and analyze **image**, **text**, and **video** data as part of my hands-on learning and internship experience.

These projects involve **multi-modal data handling**, where each data type presents unique challenges and opportunities in the context of deep learning and intelligent automation.
