# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Classification with Custom CNN

Welcome to the **Handwritten Digit Classification** project!  
In this repository, we build a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits (0–9) with high precision.  
Achieved an impressive **99% accuracy** after training for 50 epochs! 🚀
